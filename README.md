clojure-scraps
==============

Clojure examples, experiments, and code I don't want to forget.

Run scripts like:

$ java -cp /path/to/clojure-1.4.0.jar clojure.main accumulator.clj
$ java -cp /path/to/clojure-1.4.0.jar clojure.main fizzbuzz.clj

etc.

## Includes:

* fizzbuzz.clj

  Yeah, this is old, but...well, read the post: http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/

* accumulator.clj

  An accumulator (a.k.a. reduce function) based on Raganwald's "Closures and Higher Order Functions" (http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/closures-and-higher-order-functions.html) post.  Didn't implement his currying example (yet).
