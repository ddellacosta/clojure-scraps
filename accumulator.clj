;; I assume that when Raganwald said:

;; Actually, there's a far simpler way to avoid having to remember the
;; default value when you want to fold over addition. But let's just play
;; along so that we donâ€™t have to come up with an entirely new set of
;; examples to demonstrate the value of functions as first-class values.

;; ...he meant that you basically don't pass in the initial value
;; but start from the first value of the array, as reduce does?
